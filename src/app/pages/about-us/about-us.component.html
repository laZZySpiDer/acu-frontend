                            Hi, I’m Ashwini, the artist behind Ahiru’s Creative Universe 🌿
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ACU began as a few doodles in the corners of my notebooks and slowly grew into a space where
                            memories are turned into art.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At ACU, I create handmade and illustrated journals, gifts, and keepsakes, each designed to
                            hold
                            emotions gently and last beyond the moment. Everything you see here starts with a feeling, a
                            story,
                            or a memory and is then crafted with care.
                        </p>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p class="highlight-text text-primary">Before ACU, I was a Genetics student.</p>
                <p>
                    Between lab work and textbooks, I found comfort in poetry, doodles, and storytelling through art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017, a little character named Ahiru was born and she became the soul of my creative world.
                    Friends began connecting with her, asking for drawings, badges, and personalised pieces. What
                    started
                    as handmade gifts soon turned into my first customised orders and eventually, ACU.

                <p>
                    I believe even the smallest moments deserve to be remembered a smile, a phase of life, a feeling
                    you don’t want to forget. ACU is about slowing down and turning those moments into something you can
                    hold onto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every piece is made slowly, thoughtfully, and with love, using sustainable materials wherever
                    possible.
